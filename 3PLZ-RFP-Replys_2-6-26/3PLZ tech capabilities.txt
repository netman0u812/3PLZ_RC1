Technical Capabilities Delivered by 3PLZ
A. Fully Isolated Zero Trust Tenant Architecture

Each third party operates within a dedicated Virtual Landing Zone with its own routing, addressing, DNS, and security boundaries.
No direct access to internal networks; all communication forced through governed service entry points.

B. Automated, Standardized IPsec VPN Connectivity

System‑generated IPsec configuration bundles ensure consistent crypto, routing, and tunnel parameters across all vendors.
High‑availability tunnel endpoints provide reliable and location‑agnostic termination.

C. Layer‑7 Service‑Pattern Proxies for All Integrations
Three major categories of proxy capabilities:

Secure File Transfer (SFTP/SSH) with authentication, audit logging, and optional inspection.
Application‑Aware Proxies for Web, API, SaaS, and Collaboration apps with mTLS, OAuth, JWT, header/path controls, and rate enforcement.
VDI Connectivity using tenant‑specific proxy endpoints for controlled remote desktop access.

D. DNS‑Driven Control Plane

Per‑tenant DNS views, rewriting, and conditional forwarding ensure that all traffic resolves to the correct proxy endpoints.
DNS validation ties application reachability to authenticated, policy‑enforced resolution paths.

E. End‑to‑End Automation Through APIs

All workflow steps — from request intake to VPN provisioning to proxy creation — are API‑driven.
Supports integration with Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines, and other automation systems.

F. Comprehensive Observability and Logging

Detailed logs for proxy traffic, DNS activity, tunnel state, and routing sessions.
Per‑tenant metrics and telemetry exported into enterprise monitoring platforms for visibility and correlation.

G. Governance Anchored in Enterprise Identity and PKI

Role‑based access controls across the portal and APIs ensure only authorized users can request, approve, and manage connectivity.
Integrated PKI workflows for certificate issuance, renewal, and identity‑based authentication for Web and API patterns.
