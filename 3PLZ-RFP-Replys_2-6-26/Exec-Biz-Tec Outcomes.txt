3PLZ - Executive‑Level Business Outcomes
A. Reduced Enterprise Risk Exposure

Centralizes all third‑party connectivity into isolated, policy‑driven environments that remove the inconsistent and high‑risk behaviors of legacy models.
Applies identity‑aware controls and externalized enforcement to reduce the blast radius of vendor access and strengthen overall security posture.

B. Faster Time‑to‑Market for Partner Integrations

Self‑service onboarding capabilities dramatically shorten delivery cycles and eliminate dependency on manual network engineering.
Automated generation of required configurations accelerates deployments and reduces project lead times.

C. Higher Operational Efficiency and Lower Support Costs

Standardized service patterns minimize bespoke engineering and simplify long‑term operations.
Centralized logging and visibility enable faster troubleshooting and incident response across all vendor connections.

D. Stronger Compliance and Audit Alignment

Built‑in data classification, segmentation, and authentication controls ensure consistent adherence to regulatory standards.
Per‑tenant isolation and documented workflows provide a defensible audit trail for every integration.

E. Scalable Foundation for Enterprise Growth

Designed to onboard and manage a large number of third‑party tenants without increased complexity.
Supports long‑term expansion through automation, high availability, and consistent architecture.




Executive Summary (What must be true for success)

Authoritative Identity & PKI are wired into the platform:
- Self-Service platform CVS users are the coustomer
- RBAC tenant model based on service implementation in the tenant with SNOW based review and approval
- SAML IdP/ AD Group authentication required for RBAC

Tenant isolation is enforceable end‑to‑end:
- Namespace driven architecture (tenant IP addressing overlaps/Tenant to CSV addressing is unique)
- Solution has a dependency on DNS rewriting and the use of conditional forwarding
- Tenant solution provides network isolation and traffic visibility, inspection and enforcement via proxy splicing
- User and session identity driven enforcement depends on per tenant PKI and user on-boarding (not in initial project scope)

Automation is the system of record:
- Service delivery is based on patterned proxy implementation to load-balanced application front-ends
- IPSec delivery is also based on patterned delivery, no ad-hoc or bespoke connections
- Source of Truth for 3rd party partners is required (Need for formal on-board)

Observability is multi‑layer and per‑tenant:
- Logging events for DNS, Proxy Tranactions, tunnel , BGP, and app telemetry flow into SIEM with consistent IDs

Governance needs to embedded into the request flow: 
- Clear processes need to be defined for on-board, service deployment, SLA commitment, RBAC assignment
- There is no standard architecture for any of the candidate services, automated deployment requires services are architecture compliant.
